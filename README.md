> [!NOTE]
> ### Options
>
> - `includeLocalStationInfo`: Set to true to enable logos for stations without [RDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Data_System). Files are to be stored in FM-DX Webserver `/web/logos/local` folder.   
> - `prioritiseSvg`: Set to true to display 'svg' file if both 'svg' and 'webp' files exist for tuned station.   

> [!TIP]
> PNG files can be converted to WebP lossess files using XnConvert, setting the format to `WebP`, `Lossless`, and `Compression Method` to `6`.

## For stations without RDS data
* Entries can be added in `localstationdata.json` (stored in `/web/logos/json`). Once edited, confirm each line except the last ends with a comma.

* Images can be named with an underscore, followed by station frequency (stored in `/web/logos/local`). Example: `_87.600.webp`

* To change logo animation for tentatively loaded PS RDS, Open `pluginStationLogosOCE.js`, find and edit the line containing `const logoEffect`.
